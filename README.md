## The Premiere NYCMesh Member/Install Database

Welcome to the `nth` attempt at making an API! This was started out of hatred for our current solution for tracking installs/buildings/requests, the **New Node Form**.

This project aims to provide a convenient, stable, and sane API for use with robots and humans.
